        <!-- title:  SFU Computational Photography Lab creating game-changing SFX freeware, plans to distribute film production grants-->

<blockquote>
  <p>The Computational Photography Lab builds the new AI-driven technologies that will power future 3D VFX software. We are looking for partners to help us: define how the future of post-production in a creative-focused research environment, translate promising research discoveries into useful tools, and distribute these to the film making community. Our partners will gain first hand knowledge of how to best use the tools, have the opportunity to test the tools on film projects, and be able to use the tools before they are released to the general public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At SFU’s <a href="../" target="_blank">Computational Photography Lab <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>, we specialize in cutting-edge post-production tools powered by computer vision and machine learning. Our AI-driven research allows filmmakers to transform 2D footage into detailed 3D environments, enabling precise adjustments to geometry, lighting, and objects in scenes with unparalleled fidelity and resolution. This opens up next-generation post-production possibilities typically reserved for high-budget productions, making advanced editing accessible to all.
</p>

<p>
<b>We aim to invent the next-generation of post-production tools in a collaborative environment that brings indie filmmakers and AI researchers together.</b> Our lab boasts a production studio equipped with top-tier cameras and filmmaking gear for conducting AI research in an active production environment. We believe collaborating closely with creative minds in a production setting will help us develop the tools that cater to Canadian filmmakers' real needs.
</p>

<p>
The next-generation, AI-driven post-production technologies have already started to change the way films are made. While AI has immense potential to increase productivity of creatives and equitability of film production, when developed in a profit-driven mindset, AI also represents a great risk for the workers in the creative industry. <b>This is why we are developing COPHEE-CAM</b> - Computational Photography for Enhancing Equitable Canadian Moviemaking. COPHEE-CAM aims to democratize filmmaking by creating advanced, free-to-use tools for Canadian independent filmmakers and low-budget Canadian productions. Unlike AI trends that replace creative roles, our approach empowers artists with <i>analytical</i> AI, enhancing post-production capabilities for better and more affordable artistic expression.
</p>

<p>
<b>We are looking for partner organizations to make COPHEE-CAM a reality.</b> With a focus on supporting Canadian film making and equitability, we are developing a proposal for the <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/_doc/alliance/Option_2_two-pager_e.pdf" target="_blank">NSERC Alliance Grant - Option 2 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Our partners will play an important role in connecting our research team with Canadian creatives and contribute in-kind support, expertise, and commitment to guide tool development without requiring any monetary contribution.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the development of next-generation tools, COPHEE-CAM will feature activities aimed to enhance collaboration between creatives and researchers. We will offer 6-month residencies for artists at SFU for them to develop a short film in our studio, as well as workshops and events that aim to provide education for creatives on AI-based tools and gatherings to foster intellectual exchange between the creative and technical worlds.

  <div>
      <p>
      At Computational Photography Lab, we specialize in understanding the 3D world from a single view at a production-ready quality and resolution. Our goal is to model the scene in terms of geometry, illumination, and materials that will unlock the creative control over digital scenes that is today possible in tools like Blender or Unreal Engine, but for real scenes and film footage. This enhanced digital control over real scenes makes a wide range of post-production capabilities that are either impossible today, or reserved for high-budget productions.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although we have the technical expertise to develop AI-driven interactive tools, we lack in creative experience to address the real, everyday needs of Canadian filmmakers. Our partners and residents will guide us towards developing the tools that will create a more equitable filmmaking environment.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our creative advisor Erik Whittaker describes our vision for the creative possibilities we aim to unlock:
      </p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>
      Imagine being able to take a series of photographs of locations and then film actors anywhere without green screen; and, then on your own time at home, placing the dramatic performances in that set while choosing and crafting camera lenses, effects, moves and lighting that include all characters and elements.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now imagine being able to modify those locations in user friendly 3D environments, enlarging, stretching, pasting and cutting them with other locations or locations created by AI from historical photographs or physical models and then painting them and dressing these sets with modifiable objects photographed or scanned with an iPhone or the countless objects that one can download from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
      Imagine all that and then editing performances filmed separately and using a 3D space on your home computer as the new creative arena to assemble, craft and edit all.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is the creative world that we envision.
      </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  The tools and innovations we develop in collaboration with artists and researchers will be shared openly for the use of Canadian filmmakers. Our commitment to equitable access drives our mission to democratize filmmaking. We believe that the advancements made through COPHEE-CAM should benefit the entire Canadian film industry. To this end, we will provide easy and free access to the tools, resources, and knowledge generated throughout the project. This open sharing philosophy will enable filmmakers, both independent and established, to harness the power of AI-driven post-production techniques, fostering innovation and creativity within the Canadian film community.

      <p>
      The post-production sector is rapidly advancing, embracing the integration of AI-based tools across various workflows. In this context, Canadian AI initiatives play a crucial role in positioning the Canadian post-production landscape as a formidable contender on the global stage. We believe that developing new AI-based tools, with a focus on collaborating with creatives and providing educational support for them, is the optimal approach to empower Canadian filmmaking in the coming age, all while keeping equity at the forefront.
